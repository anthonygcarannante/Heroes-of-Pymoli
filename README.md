# Heroes-Of-Pymoli

For this assignment, I decided to analyze the video game data from the fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli. After analyzing all of the data in my notebook, I have noticed the following 3 trends in this dataset.

1. Of the 780 purchases and the 576 players in the dataset, the large majority of these players were males (84.03%). ThereÂ is a small but not insignificant percentage of these players that are females (14.06%). Due to the majority of male players, the revenue generated by males was the highest among the three gender groups.

2. The majority of players are in the age range of 15-29 years old consisting of roughly 75% of the total player population, with 20-24 year olds accounting for just under half (44.79%) of the number of total players.

3. Of the five most popular items that were purchased for the game among players, three of them also generated the most revenue for the game (Final Critic, Oathbreaker, Firey Glass Crusader). It would be a good idea to sell items similar to these items to create more revenue and increase popularity in the game.
